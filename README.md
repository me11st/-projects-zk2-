**A Transparent, Fair Tendering System Powered by Blockchain & AI**

Public procurement today faces two major issues: **lack of transparency** and **lack of trust**.

**ZK-Tender** is a new kind of digital tendering system that makes it **hard to cheat and easy to trust**.

Built on **blockchain** and governed by **open AI logic**, it ensures that:

- Every company submits their proposal in secret, stored immutably on the blockchain.
- After submissions close, citizens get **one week** to **read**, **vote**, or **flag** proposals.
- An **AI system** evaluates all bids using **pre-agreed public criteria** — price, delivery time, quality, track record — and even citizen feedback.
- The winning company is **paid in steps**, with **penalties for delays** and **bonuses for exceeding expectations**.
- All contracts, votes, and outcomes are **public — forever**.

ZK-Tender acts as a **digital notary, judge, accountant, and watchdog — all in one** — with no bias, no backdoors, and no lost paperwork.

> We believe every euro spent in the public sector should be auditable by anyone, anytime.

## 📜 Policy Spec: Public Voting & Flagging in ZK-Tender

### 🧭 Voting Period:

### 🧭 **Voting Period**

- **Opens:** Immediately after the tender submission deadline.
- **Closes:** 7 days after opening.
- **Goal:** Empower public oversight without overriding initial AI assessments.

---

### 🗳️ **Who Can Vote?**

- Any **EU citizen** with a verified **eID**.
- *(Temporary phase: Users with a verified wallet and governance token may participate.)*
- **One person = one vote**, enforced via **ZK-proof of uniqueness** (e.g., Sismo, Zupass).
- Voters must **stake 1€ worth of governance token** to cast a vote.

---

### 📥 **What Can Voters Do?**

- **Upvote** proposals they believe are strong or in the public interest.
- **Flag** proposals they find suspicious or unfit.

---

### 🚩 **Flagging Criteria & Triggers**

A proposal is **flagged for secondary review** if any of the following conditions are met:

### 🔢 Quantitative Trigger:

- **≥10% of total voters** flag the same proposal.

### ⚠️ Qualitative Triggers (user-submitted flags for):

- **Plagiarism** or unoriginal content.
- **Unrealistic execution timelines or budgets.**
- **Track record of misconduct** or failed public contracts.
- **Conflict of interest** (e.g., ties to government officials or insider favoritism).

### 🧠 AI/Metadata Analysis Flags:

- Suspicious bid values (e.g., significantly under average).
- Missing required documents or data anomalies.
- Usage of known boilerplate or duplicated tender applications.

Flags **don’t alter scores**, but automatically trigger:

- A **risk review**.
- A **transparency audit** (manual or automated).
- **Conditional approval**, with enhanced post-contract tracking.
- **Record updates** that may affect future eligibility.

---

### 🎁 Incentive System for Flagging:

### 🔓 Who Can Flag?

- Anyone with verified wallet & ZK-Tokens.
- Accredited NGOs or journalists can flag **without staking**, but must attach proof.

### 💸 Rewards & Outcomes:

| Outcome | Description | Result | Reward |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ Verified & impactful | Flag triggered actual action (disqualification, audit, etc.) | Confirmed | **2× stake** |
| ⚠️ Partially verified | Info was correct, but minor or not actionable | Logged | **1.1× stake** |
| ❌ Unfounded (good faith) | Wrong but well-meant | No action taken | **No refund**, no penalty |
| 🚫 Malicious flag | Intentionally misleading | Sanctioned | **Stake lost + warning/ban** |

---

### 🎮 Optional Gamified Layer:

- Flagging success earns **XP/Civic Score**.
- High XP unlocks:
    - “🛡️ Watchdog” badges
    - Eligibility to join **citizen panels**.
- Top watchdogs get **monthly token rewards** or early access to policy proposals.

---

### ⏱️ **Post-Voting Phase: Final AI Evaluation**

Once the **7-day public voting window** closes:

1. **All proposals** — whether flagged or not — are re-evaluated by the AI, this time with **full visibility**, including:
    - **Company names**
    - **Ownership structure**
    - **Past performance**
    - **Flag data** (quantitative + qualitative)
    - **Public votes** (support/flag count)
2. **Previously hidden metadata** is revealed to the AI for:
    - Bias detection
    - Insider connection checks
    - Legal compliance (e.g., no conflict of interest, fair pricing)
3. **Flagged proposals** receive a **risk score adjustment** and:
    - **Trigger a trust penalty**, if patterns match prior fraud indicators.
    - May be sent for **manual oversight**, especially if AI confidence is low.
4. **Top-scoring proposals** move on to final shortlisting, followed by:
    - Publication on-chain
    - Appeal window (optional)
    - Contract signing

---

### 📊 **Final Output**

Each proposal receives:

- **Final Score** (based on merit + integrity signals)
- **AI Confidence Level**
- **Flag Impact Report**
- **Audit Risk Level**

### 🤖 Why Blockchain? Why AI? (in human words)

**Let’s face it — public tenders are complicated.**

They involve piles of documents, weeks of waiting, and people you’ve never met deciding how your tax money is spent.

**That’s why ZK-Tender uses two modern tools:**

---

### 🔐 **Blockchain = Trust Without Trusting**

Think of blockchain like a digital ledger that nobody can secretly change — not even the government.

- Every tender submission is saved securely and can’t be edited or hidden.
- Anyone can audit it — today, tomorrow, or in 10 years.
- It’s like having a public notary and an accountant in the same room.

🧾 Result: No secret deals. No lost paperwork. No “oops.”

---

### 🧠 **AI = Fair, Fast, and Data-Based Decisions**

AI doesn’t drink coffee, go on vacation, or pick favorites.

- It compares tenders using **pre-defined public rules** (like price, speed, track record).
- It reads fast and spots red flags (like unrealistic offers or hidden connections).
- It doesn’t replace humans — it supports better decisions, faster.

🎯 Result: No bias. No delays. Better value for taxpayers.

---

### 💡 In short:

Blockchain **keeps things clean**,

AI **keeps things fair**,

And ZK-Tender **lets everyone watch**.

### 💰 Smart Contract Payment Logic (ZK-Tender)

**📦 Payout in Milestones**

- The winning company is paid in **stages**, not all at once.
- Each milestone (e.g., 30%, 40%, 30%) is released **after verification** of progress.

**⚖️ Bonus & Penalty System**

- **Bonus:** If a company delivers faster or exceeds expectations (quality, cost-saving), they receive a **performance reward** (from staked pool or treasury).
- **Penalty:** If late or under-delivering, next payment is reduced or withheld.
- **Citizen feedback & audit triggers** may affect the final payout.

**🪙 Staking-Incentive Loop**

- Part of the tender’s budget is **temporarily staked**.
- If everything goes smoothly, **company receives that stake as bonus**.
- If issues arise, that stake gets redirected to:
    - **Audits**
    - **Voters who flagged issues**
    - **Public reward pool**

**🔒 Immutable & Transparent**

- All terms are coded in the smart contract.
- Every payout, delay, or penalty is **visible and provable** on-chain.

# zkTender Demo

A Next.js (TypeScript, Tailwind) frontend for a privacy-preserving tender system on StarkNet.

## Features
- StarkNet wallet connect (Braavos/ArgentX via starknet.js)
- Proposal submission form (name, feasibility, budget, innovation, attachments - for test just marked with numbers)
- Poseidon hash (via circomlibjs) for privacy
- Mock ERC20 balance check (no real contract required)
- Proposals hidden until deadline (zk layer)
- AI evaluation pipeline (Node.js + OpenAI, see below)
- Modern, beautiful UI

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Run the frontend
```sh
npm run dev
```

### 3. Mock ERC20 & Wallet
- The app uses a mock ERC20 contract address and always shows a balance for demo purposes.

### 4. Proposal Privacy & Reveal
- Proposals are hidden until the deadline (see `SUBMISSION_DEADLINE` in `src/app/page.tsx`).
- After the deadline, proposals are revealed (company names are anonymized).

### 5. AI Evaluation Pipeline
- Proposals are stored in `src/app/mock_proposals.json`.
- To run the AI evaluation:
  1. Set your OpenAI API key:
     ```sh
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
     ```
  2. Run the script:
     ```sh
     node src/app/eval_proposals.js
     ```
  3. Results are saved to `src/app/ai_results.json`.

### 6. Customization
- To change the submission deadline, edit `SUBMISSION_DEADLINE` in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- To add proposals, edit `src/app/mock_proposals.json`.

## File Overview
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Main Next.js frontend
- `src/app/mock_proposals.json` — Mock proposals for demo/AI
- `src/app/eval_proposals.js` — Node.js script for anonymization + OpenAI evaluation
- `src/app/ai_results.json` — AI-generated scores/comments
- `ERC20.cairo` — Minimal Cairo 1 ERC20 contract (for reference/testing)

## Notes
- All blockchain and AI calls are mocked for demo/dev.
- For a real deployment, connect to live contracts and secure proposal storage.
